# Note-Taker



This application uses expressjs to handle routing of two different pages: the home page and the note page. The notes page allows the user to write notes and save them to a JSON file. Notes can be added and deletedby using the respective new note and delete buttons. The readonly property of the notes fields can be toggled with the lock icon.
